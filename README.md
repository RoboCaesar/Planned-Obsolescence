# Planned-Obsolesence
I started this project to learn C# and the Monogame framework.

PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE
--------------------

Game Description:
You're the nameless hero, who has one job: Get rid of obsolete technology. Destroy it all! To do that, you need to use your trusty hammer with its ability to not only smack down old machines, but also cause earthquakes and launch fireballs. Collect gems to increase your speed and strength. However, the old tech of the world won't go down easily! Try not to die!

Directions:
Move up/down/left/right: Arrow keys
Basic hammer attack: Z
Charged attack: Hold down Z and release after a couple of seconds.
Special attack: X
Place a bomb (when available): C
In-game menu: ESC
Confirm menu selection: Enter

Development notes:
As I've progressed, I've realized how inefficient some of the earlier code is. If I were to start again, I would certainly do some things differently!
